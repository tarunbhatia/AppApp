    <string name="AboutStr">We are three simple techies from Seattle that wanted to try creating an app on our own. We are also three simple techies that are a bit overwhelmed by the election process and the amount of candidates; but we LOVE this country and want to do our civic duty in an intelligent manner. So we decided to create a little app, just the facts, so that you too can make an informed decision. We hope to improve on this initial version, all the way up to the swearing in on January 20th, 2017. So please let us know what you might like to see in future versions.</string>
